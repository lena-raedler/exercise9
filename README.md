<strong>Continuous Integration</strong>

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.
Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, whitch allows teams to detect problems early.

By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

Because of the more frequent integration you are less likey to step back and watch where things went wrong. But you have much more time to build new features on the one hand.

On the other hand, Coninuous Integrations is cheap. 
If you don't follow a continuous approach, you might kick your project off-shedule because bugs are hard to find and fix.

All in all, Continuous Integration brings a lot of benefits to your corporation.
